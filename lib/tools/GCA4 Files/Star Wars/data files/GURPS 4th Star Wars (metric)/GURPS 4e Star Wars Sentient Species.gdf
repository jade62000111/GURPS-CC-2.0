The Amanin have small mouths, which function as both a way to eat, and a way to expel undigested material from their bodies. Their mouth is also the location of their reproductive organs, and this makes it very difficult for other species to tell the difference between male and female Amanin. The Amanin bulbous eyes are a deep, dark red color, and they can see easily in dark conditions. They have extremely long arms that enable them to easily swing in the branches of the jungles on Maridun, and have enormous hands that are roughly half a yard long. Each hand sports long claws, which, combined with the hands' size, enable them to grasp and ensnare struggling prey. They have short legs, which hinder their walking movement severely, but their unusual body shape enables them to roll along the ground at great speeds, making them swift in their natural environment. They have the ability to regenerate lost limbs and organs, and their brains are actually a network of small bundles of nerves that, along with other vital organs, are distributed throughout their bodies. This combination makes the Amanin very difficult to kill.),

They have small, round eyes with no lids or lashes, and their thin mouth openings are nearly lipless.
